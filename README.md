# opws-accounts

Loosely-structured records of how OPWS profiles got written.

see https://github.com/opws/domainprofiles/issues/148

## Starting a new profile / review

Open a guest / incognito / private browser window and open:

- https://sharklasers.com/ (for email)
- https://gist.github.com/ (for saving specimens)
- the website's registration form and everything else getting tested

## This is not BugMeNot

Most of the test accounts created for review here are kept around after the review is done (ie. I don't delete them), in case they'll be useful for just revisiting an aspect of the site at a later point, or legacy account handling (like finding out if inactive and/or pre-migration accounts have been evicted). Please don't use them for your own purposes. If you need a throwaway account, you can make a new one using GuerillaMail yourself, or pull one from http://bugmenot.com/ and use that.
