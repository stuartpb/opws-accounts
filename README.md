## how to make a sandbox in two seconds

open a "Guest" browser window and open:

- https://sharklasers.com/ (for email)
- https://gist.github.com/ (for saving specimens)
- the website's registration form and everything else getting tested

## throwing up in one shot

```sh
git config alias.hurl='!git add by-domain && git commit --allow-empty-message -m "" && git push'
```

then you can `git hurl` constantly like this is dropbox or something

## don't be a dick

these are for testing site mechanisms, don't use them for content or interaction. that'd be a real Dick Move&trade;.
