# opws-testaccounts

Loosely-structured records of how OPWS profiles got written.

see https://github.com/opws/domainprofiles/issues/148

## Starting a new profile / review

Open a guest / incognito / private browser window and open:

- https://sharklasers.com/ (for email)
- https://gist.github.com/ (for saving specimens)
- the website's registration form and everything else getting tested

## This is not BugMeNot

Most of the test accounts created for review here are kept around after the review is done (ie. I don't delete them), in case they'll be useful for just revisiting an aspect of the site at a later point, or legacy account handling (like finding out if inactive and/or pre-migration accounts have been evicted). Please don't use them for your own purposes. If you need a throwaway account, you can make a new one using GuerillaMail yourself, or pull one from http://bugmenot.com/ and use that.

## Hypothetically Asked Questions

### Why are specimens links to Gist instead of files in the tree?

Because the average .mhtml is like a megabyte and it would massively bloat the repo. Yes, the email specimens are a lot lighter, but at this point we've already got the Gist tab open, why not use it for both?

### What's this "flash" I keep reading about? Surely you don't mean *that* Flash?

A "flash" is an ephemeral message that appears with a loaded based on some previous state in the session, rather than anything that's encapsulated in the address. The term, as far as I can tell, has its roots in [CCEB military terminology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_precedence#FLASH_.28Z.29), and has since been used in frameworks like [Typo3](https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/CoreApiReference/ApiOverview/FlashMessages/Index.html), [Ruby on Rails](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Flash.html),  [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/patterns/flashing/), and [Express / Connect](https://github.com/expressjs/express-messages).
