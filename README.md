1. right click the sharklasers link, open in incognito
2. new tab in that incognito window, go to the site
3. do whatever

```sh
git config alias.hurl='!git add by-domain && git commit --allow-empty-message -m "" && git push'
```

then you can `git hurl` constantly like this is dropbox or something
