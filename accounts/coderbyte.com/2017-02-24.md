## Registration

any all-digits username came back "Please change your username" so I'm inferring they require a letter

## password change

All the labels are span tags, gross

The old password field is an input called `new_pass_FAKE` that starts pre-filled "First type in your current password." and then swaps it out via `display: none` with `new_pass` after the first keypress, like there's no such thing as the placeholder attribute. Nasty.

Note that the form after doing this links back to https://coderbyte.com/CodingArea/Settings/ rather than the URL they use now

Password change takes you to the password change page again, but if you try to set it again (or go anywhere else), it appears that setting the password signs you out?

## login

Similar hijinks and foolishness with the login page password input: they don't switch it to type=password until it gets an input event, because they prefill it with bespoke placeholder text.

Surprisingly, even though their login form rejects password longer than 40 characters, the password change form does in fact reject passwords differing after 9000 characters.

## Issue pings

### Not-yet-profiled registration fields

- Country (opws/domainprofiles#277)

### Invalid account password reset (opws/domainprofiles#28)

entering an invalid email redirects to the landing page??

entering a nonexistent email says "Please check your email" but not "Password changed, please check your email"
