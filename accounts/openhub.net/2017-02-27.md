## Registration

They call your username your "login"

Have to verify with mobile number (Digits by Twitter) or GitHub

Trying via Digits failed, see "phone number failure" specimen

I'm going to real quick put together a new GitHub account to test this with, even though it says they don't save that info

going to the password reset page locked me at https://www.openhub.net/activation_resends/new because apparently I forgot to check an activation email? I never saw any

and after requesting it be re-sent, I'm STILL not seeing it

assuming it was something in the tricky email / username, giving up and trying again from scratch, see 2017-02-28 account
