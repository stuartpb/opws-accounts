Got stuck at the exact same point as the 2017-02-27 account, I'm bailing out and trying with my own account

And the password reset email isn't sending for that, either. Giving up and running with what I could determine.

OH WAIT HUH - logging out and back in propted me to change my notification settings, doing that lets me change password

rejects all-spaces passwords, but seems to handle passwords with space on the ends correctly (ie two spaces + 'a' + two spaces is not seen as the same as 'a' + four spaces)

Password reset emails still aren't working

## Issue pings
