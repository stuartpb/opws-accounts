Whoa, there's an option on the register page to *skip* registration, work using a demo dashboard, and set up your account after you've figured out what you're doing. That's pretty cool, and bodes well for registartion being easy enough to demo.

Their dashboard cuts off the left side when the window's not sufficiently wide, though. Boo, fail.

## Registration, take 1

trying to submit a short password comes back "Password must be at least 8 characters and at most 256 characters", so that's nice, though it'd be cooler if it just said that initially

Entering "aaaaaaaa" comes back "Please provide a password", which, uh?

Same goes for "uuuuuuuu" and "gggggggg" and "IIIIIIII" and "!!!!!!!!" so I guess they don't let you use passwords that are all the same character. Same goes for "Aaaaaaaa".

Okay, entering "aAaAaAaA" finally gives a damn rule: "To keep your business's data safe, we require a strong password containing at least one lowercase, uppercase, number, and special character." ugh

now it's prompting me for a number... let's try one from smsreceivefree

UUUGH I broke the registration form, it doesn't let you back out if you don't initially choose to skip phone association and https://smsreceivefree.com/view/13127641152/ isn't showing any text (and it looks like they mask numbers so I wouldn't want to use it anyway)

uuugh... I'm just going to start again from the top. I've attached the stub for the aborted registration, in case there's ever a reason to mess with that. And now I know not to try associating a phone.

## Registration, take 2

Hmm... for some reason it skipped the phone number thing this time and took me straight to the dashboard?

So it looks like registration DOES log you in... maybe I'll try logging this one out and seeing if verifying the other one DOES log you in as well

Following the registration email... requires you to enter your password? It says "log in" but I'm already logged in, I just refreshed the user settings page, still loads

Hah, getting the password wrong says "Wrong email or password", like the email could be wrong

Submitting that goes right back to  https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/dashboard

## Changing password

Ah, okay... trying "aaaaaaaa" and submitting here explains the rule: "To keep your business's data safe, we do not allow passwords that have a character repeated 4 or more times consecutively." that's dumb

trying other stuff raises the same composition rules that were mentioned earlier, urg

Submitting the change closes the dialog

Trying to change to the same password reports back the error "New password should be different from old password"

## Password reset

I'm considering getting tricky with the first account I registered to see if login still works if you're already signed into an account, but... nah. Maybe some day, though

For some reason, the reset page, and only the reset page, has a strength checker

Via that strength checker, I discovered that the asinine composition rules are only imposed if your password is 15 characters or fewer, so I stripped this out in favor of a `must` explaining the rule, like GitHub:

```yaml
    required:
      classes:
      - lowers
      - uppers
      - numbers
      - special
```

the "no characters repeated 4+ times" thing is still universal though which is dumb
