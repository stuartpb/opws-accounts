fields that aren't focused look like they're disabled because "ooh, light gray is pretty!"

aaaaaa, bbbbbb, cccccc, zzzzzz, abcdef, fedcba were all rejected, but "dripped" is fine so idk

registering directs to https://path.com/welcome which states that you're logged in even though you're not

after logging in via https://path.com/login you're directed to https://path.com/account

going back to https://path.com/login hangs for a bit then causes an internal server error jfc

changing your password churns and then I think signs you out, you're directed back to /

trying to input a password of just numbers raises the error "Password should contain letters and numbers."

as bad as a lot of this is I have to say that this is one of the nicest account settings pages I've ever seen, everything fits neatly on one page with no bullshit navigation tabs

ok abc123 works so I think it's just one check if every character is the same or sequential

it took some digging but eventually I figured out the max length is 256 as that's when the error went from "please pick a shorter password" to "please pick a stronger password"

also btw that's with "AaA" at the beginning so the "same character" test is probably case insensitive

revisiting an expired link doesn't raise an error until you try to submit again
