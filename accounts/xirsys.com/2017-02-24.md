## Registration

Signup is per-plan, I'm profiling based on https://dashboard.xirsys.com/signup/account/free/monthly because I'd expect they'd all look the same - does require a little clickthrough, though.

`opw's <script>alert(1)</script> test?? ://--` in the username field turned into `opw's <script>alert&#40;1&#41;</script> test?? ://--` when it bounced? trying this as the company name

all=spaces password: "You have not entered a password"

trying seven spaces and then "a":

> Your password can only include the alpha-numeric characters, as well as the characters *, -, ., [, or ].

PFFFFT

more trying to jinx the system: names can only contain letters and spaces, username "may only contain lowercase letters" (yes, it even rejects digits, I tried)

the company name appears to accept numbers, though they won't admit it. first and last name are letters-and-spaces only, because nobody has names with apostrophes or hyphens

completing registration goes directly to the dashboard: https://dashboard.xirsys.com/dashboard

api token is on the dashboard, I should probably profile that. Heck, I'll specimen this page, why not

## password change

as far as I can tell there isn't any

### password reset

going to the reset page, or submitting it if already loaded from before log in, while logged in, redirects to the dashboard

the FAQ says you can reset at any time via the dashboard, but I don't see it - there's the API token (which is UUID-like, not sure if it's actually a valid UUID though because the key bits don't look right) but that's not the login password

anyway, testing reset by logging out. directs to the signin page after clicking signout

they appear to be using that "Did you mean" email thing whose name I can't remember here

typing "foo@example.com", the form is green but nothing is coming up?

stub mentions the sender address, good job

After you reset, you don't even get a stub page, you *stay on the password reset page* (with a flash to confirm the password was changed), and can *keep resetting the password*, and the token doesn't expire, even if you reuse it. What a mess.

Mangling the token to figure out what expiration even *would* look like: they check password entry matching and reject on that first, before telling you the token expired.
