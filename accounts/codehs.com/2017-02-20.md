while I'm listing https://codehs.com/signup/begin as the registration page, there are a lot of options that are out-of-scope here, so I'm going to actually profile https://codehs.com/signup/teacher because that's simplest

not profiling the "teaching experience" field obviously

trying to go anywhere traps you in https://codehs.com/signup/teacher_info?info_required=1, including account settings and following a password reset token

https://www.codehs.com/forgot_password loads fine, though, curiously enough

I'm just going to reuse:

    Sample School
    123 Front Street, San Francisco
    California

that appears when the trap loads for some reason (it disappears after you type anything to search and gets replaced with a "Can't find it?" button)

man this form looks REALLY bad at responsive widths (the "City" input is barely wider than it is tall)

the change password form appears to accept blank inputs...

it accepts that. my god. you actually have to hack the `required` attribute off of the password input via Inspect Element to get it to recognize your actual password at login. yowza.

hah, the intercom widget just popped up. I'm considering hopping over to my real account to send them "if you're going to accept zero-length passwords on accounts then you should remove the required attribute on password on the login form"

apparently they forgot to put bootstrap attributes in for the password reset change form

resetting password while logged in directs to the dashboard, I'm guessing it's reset-logs-you-in

password reset for nonexistent accounts is the same as existent ones

Hmm... turns out it's NOT a login token thing, it's just unchanged, and submitting the token while logged out directs to /login, so basically destination can't be profiled
