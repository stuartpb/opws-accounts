## Registration

the verification email has a link (button) followed by the URL (linked), so it would look like this if verification were profiled the way password reset is:

```yaml
email:
  sender: notifications@yammer.com
  body: [link, url]
```

I'm not going to bother trying to figure out how the "change email" thing works on this page, for now, because it's so far out of scope - I assume it'd re-send the verification email to the new address, and then you'd have to fill out this form all over again?

note that there are optional "Department" and "Job Title" inputs, "Department" having a typeahead

Hmm, I just realized that there'd really need to be a specimen for the document's outerHTML to capture this script stuff (not that outerHTML is perfect). https://github.com/opws/opws-surveyor-extension/issues/1

After submitting the registration completion, there's a "Who do you work with?" page - if you click "Next" without filling it out as I did, you skip on through to the group page (https://www.yammer.com/tmail.opws.org/#/home in this case).

# Changing password

Technically, navigating to password settings led to https://www.yammer.com/tmail.opws.org/#/account/password?from=profile_settings_nav (which is what's saved as a specimen here) - https://www.yammer.com/account/password is similar, but doesn't have a nav bar.

The only other difference I can see is that, strangely, the former has a limit of *6* characters on a password, while the *latter* (that isn't actually accessible through any UI) has a limit of *8*. The passwords still get rejected when submitting with the same rules from registration, ie "Your password is too short." (if you try a 6-character one on the former) or "Your password is not allowed." (violating the blacklist), but it's not part of the in-page validation.

The change password page has a link to the password reset form.

Changing it spawns a notification email.

## Password reset

Email says it'll expire in "a few days"

Ugh, password reset only enforces a limit of 6.

I forgot to save a specimen for the reset page and I only did the reset while logged out (I can't remember if I did that logout or if the site did), so I'm going to do it again, this time logged in

BTW, a logged-out page links to https://www.yammer.com/logout_landing

Huh, resetting *also* sends a change notification email. Maybe I should be profiling these notifications?

Going to the forgot password page while logged in, unsurprisingly, pre-fills the logout email

Ugh, I forgot to save a specimen for the reset page AGAIN. Ugh, whatever, it's not like there's anything meaningful to save in a specimen for it now. Maybe later I'll try again.

Visiting an expired link redirects to the password reset link request page with a flash stating that the link is no longer valid

Flashes fade out after a second, geez, what awful UX, not everybody can read super-fast yo

Password reset DOES check against the blacklist, strangely. `aaaaaaaa` throws an "Invalid password." message up, but `aaaaaa` is fine.

Passwords appear to be truncated - after setting the test password with `$0.value='Aa'+new Array(9001).join('A')`, the change password form accepted it with a `!` appended.

## Issue pings

### Invalid account password reset (opws/domainprofiles#28)

Password reset request always spits the same stub, regardless of if you even gave it a valid email address. See https://www.yammer.com/forgotten_password?email=foobar for an example.

### Password truncation (opws/domainprofiles#233)

There's definitely truncation happening here - no time to test the limit, but it's somewhere before 9000.
