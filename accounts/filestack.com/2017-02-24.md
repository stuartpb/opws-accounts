Filepicker went through like three separate renames back and forth before settling at Filestack.com (http://blog.filestack.com/news/creating-perfect-picker-just-beginning-introducing-filestack/), so I'm just going to skip Legacies for this altogether and just do the move

## Registration

They allow login via Slack, which I've never seen before... I guess this'd be
`*.slack.com` in `thirdparty.auth.providers`, though it does raise the important point that lists of domains like this will have to be interpreted in this fashion, with potential wildcards in the domains. (Right now, we'll say that domains are always 1:1 with `WILDCARD` profiles, but that's not necessarily always going to be the case.)

The terms are implicit, but it's phrased like a checkbox ("I agree") instead of "by registering", which is weird.

submitting the form from https://dev.filestack.com/register/ gave... an empty response?

Doesn't appear to be any verification or even confirmation after registering, one wonders why they even bother asking for a phone number if that's the case

## Password change

You have to click the "Change Password" `#change-password` button

rofl, single space is an acceptable password on the change form

truncation test passed, end-of-line changes fail to match, correct 9k password accepted

## Password reset

I entered a missing email and it flashed the confirmation on the main dashboard where I was logged in - exact same behavior as resetting with a valid email.

The reset password works for password reset... if it just sets your password directly like this, shouldn't there be a profile value to note that, because it's a huge red flag (as this is a lockout mechanism)?

ok wtf I set the password to ` a ` and then the first reply after I tried to log in was just the word "invalid" as the entire response (no HTML), now neither `a` mor ` a ` will log me in (but the page is coming back with actual content...

hmm, now ` a ` works, either I was mistyping it or the page had just broken somehow

yeah I just logged out and logged in and got the same bug, resubmitting gave the same result, then straight-up disposing and reloading worked just fine

changing it to "test" workd for login, then resetting the password, yeah, locks me out

reset when logged out redirects to the login page

## Issue pings

### Invalid account password reset (opws/domainprofiles#28)

There's the same flash for both (see specimens), and the invalid login message is "invalid email or password"
