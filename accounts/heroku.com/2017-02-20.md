## Registration

not profiling an optional "Company name" field

ANOTHER site with a required Country dropdown that doesn't couch it in "Country / Region"

There's also a required dropdown for "Primary Development Language" that's not getting profiled

### Hitting a brief snag

"The domain sharklasers.com has been blocked." UUUUURGH (proceeds to try a half-dozen similar services which are all also blocked)

Considering how popular free computing time services like Heroku are for hijacking Bitcoin mining time, I guess that makes sense

Well, the upshot of this is that it's led me to discover the *fan-damn-tastic* Mailsac service, so now that's set up for future use

### Back to registration

The clever thing about how Heroku structures registration is that I *can't* try to login without opening the verification email

set initial password (it calls any password that doesn't span at least 2 classes "weak" regardless of length), then clicked through the stub to go to https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps

## changing password

Clicked through to settings and tried changing password to "password", which worked fine. Either I wasn't trying hard enough during registration, or they don't apply that strength mandate after the first time you set a password.

changing the password reloads the settings with a flash message of "Password updated."

## Password Reset

reset request for a non-existent address looks the same as reset request for an existent address

reset password to aaaaaaaa, got directed to the login form with flash confirmation, reloading page with tab open to the dashboard also directs to https://id.heroku.com/login so it looks like reset logs you out

reopening the link doesn't error, only after submitting does it pop an error
