registration starts with a "Hire" or "Work" selection, no surprise there

clicking "Hire" goes to https://www.upwork.com/signup/create-account/client_direct

clicking "Work" goes to https://www.upwork.com/signup/create-account/freelancer_direct and is what I'm profiling as it contains all the same fields and more

not profiling a required "select country" dropdown (and yes, it says "Country" not "Country or Region", and it DOES include China as well as Taiwan, someone didn't get the memo)

there's also a "How did you hear about Upwork?" I'm not profiling

registration uses a DIFFERENT captcha from password reset, all lower-case but DOES include numbers

spam checkbox (#175) is called "Yes! Send me genuinely useful emails every now and then to help me get the most out of Upwork."

trying to go anywhere after registration redirects to https://www.upwork.com/signup/please-verify until clicking the emailed link

after verifying it directs to https://www.upwork.com/ab/create-profile/experience-level/ and has you fill out your profile, same kind of trapping procedure

I filled out this whole form, including address, just so I could find the "change password" page

going to user settings stops at https://www.upwork.com/ab/account-security/reenter-password which is exactly what it sounds like

entering the password from before but with a "2" tacked onto the end was still accepted so yeah, looks like they still truncate at 60

trying to go to the Change Password page, or, again, presumably anywhere, I'm trapped again in "Create security question" which came up right after reentering the old password

it requires a checkbox for "I understand my account will be locked if I am unable to answer this question", there's also a "Remember this computer"

OK, finally got to the change password page

"At least 8 characters in length (a strong password has at least 14 characters)"

Oh yes, you have to enter the old password AGAIN, AS WELL

I'm deleting the bit about "creation does not enforce length limit" because it looks like NOTHING enforces the length limit, it's all just silently truncated (#233)

After refreshing sharklasers I FINALLY got the emails that had been sent out

Following the password reset link while logged in... logged me out and redirected me to the password reset request form, WTF

I'm profiling that as "logout" even though the reality is so, so much worse

needless to say, changing passwords via reset doesn't generate a notification email
